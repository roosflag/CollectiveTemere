# Session Recap – Murder at the Docks

## ⚓ Arrival at Ellsworth Crossing

After days of uneasy travel — including:

- A sealed shrine of Seabrin that refused to respond
- A bizarre encounter with two-headed forest giants fleeing a "green thunder"
- A river that *felt wrong*

The party arrived at **Ellsworth Crossing**, a structured, well-kept trade city with merchant docks and visible wealth.

Tensions were already high.

Then the Dockmaster was murdered.

## 🔪 The Murder of Jakom

As the River Badger docked, chaos erupted.

Dockmaster **Jakom** lay dying — throat slit.

Captain Elawin was kneeling over him.

City guards immediately seized **Tarn**, claiming eyewitnesses had seen him commit the act.

The party protested.

An old dockhand had spoken with them moments before — but when they searched for him?

He was gone.

---

## 🧩 Immediate Theories

- Tarn was framed.
- Someone disguised as Tarn committed the murder.
- A shapechanger may be involved.
- The dockhand they spoke to is highly suspicious.
- The murder was too convenient.

Elawin granted the party **2–3 days** before she departs — Tarn will face trial within 1–2 days.

Time is limited.

## 🏛️ The City Guard & Political Pressure

The guards insist they have eyewitnesses.

However:
- Public unrest is possible.
- The noble house will demand justice.
- Executing the wrong man could destabilize the city.

The party now has:
- A window before trial
- Guard suspicion
- No hard evidence

## 🔥 The Army of Light

Two members of the **Army of Light** patrol the city.

They claim to:
- Hunt abnormalities
- Stamp out dangerous magic
- Serve the gods (except Demi)

They have recently established a chapter house here.

Magic users are not welcome.

This complicates everything.

## 🐀 Tarn’s Prison Subplot

Inside the guardhouse, Tarn meets:

**Tobin** – a petty thief
- Claims to work for a "Coalition"
- Mentions a thieves’ organization trying to destabilize noble power
- Says Jakom was an obstacle
- Reveals a powerful persuasion amulet exists in the city

Tarn now knows:
- There is political unrest beneath the surface
- The Dockmaster's death may not be random
- The thieves’ coalition may benefit from chaos

## 🎭 The Infiltration Plan

Meanwhile, the party splits:

- **Garrett** investigates the docks and makes contact with underworld elements
- **Cyrus** secures performance rights at the inn
- **Cookies will be baked**
- A public show will be staged
- The goal: draw nobles, guards, dockworkers — and flush out the shapeshifter

Plan:
- Perform.
- Gather attention.
- Gain an audience with Jakom’s son.
- Interrogate dockhands.
- Clear Tarn’s name.

Or…

Break him out.

## ⏳ Current Situation

- Tarn sits in jail.
- Trial within 48-72 hours.
- Army of Light in the city.
- Political tension brewing.
