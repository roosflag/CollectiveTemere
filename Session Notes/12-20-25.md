# Session Summary – Eggs, River Gods, and the Green Fog

## 🥚 The Egg Problem
The party began the session facing the consequences of retrieving **only two-and-a-half of three stolen eggs** from a group of river creatures. One egg had been partially lost (and partially dissolved), which immediately put negotiations on shaky ground.

The creatures were **not pleased**.

To buy time, the party attempted deception and illusion:
- A **Minor Illusion** was used to fake a third egg
- Deception rolls initially succeeded
- The illusion eventually dropped at a critical moment

This revelation escalated tensions dramatically.

## 🦅 The Caged Birdman
Nearby, the party discovered a **large birdfolk (aarakocra)** held prisoner in a crude wooden-and-rope cage. The birdman was silent, proud, and clearly not there by choice.

Despite warnings, the party:
- **Freed the birdman**
- Returned the eggs to the river creatures
- Attempted to negotiate peace after the fact

The river creatures revealed the birdman had been captured as a **sacrifice**, not a criminal.

---

## ⚔️ River Combat
Negotiations broke down, leading to combat with **river-dwelling naga-like creatures**.

Key moments:
- The birdman was freed mid-conflict
- Several party members were **thrown into the river**
- Heavy melee and ranged attacks bloodied the creatures quickly
- Sneak attacks, smites, chaos magic, and crossbow fire turned the tide
- The final enemy was slain, its body floating lifelessly downstream

The party salvaged **fins, scales, and trophies** from the defeated creatures.

## 🌊 Divine Intervention – Seabrin Appears
As the river calmed, the water itself stopped flowing.

From the river rose **Seabrin**, a towering water deity — an embodiment of river, storm, and current. He revealed:
- He had been listening to prayers
- The party had earned **temporary safe passage**
- Their actions had drawn the attention of the gods

The birdman addressed Seabrin directly, hinting at a deeper connection to divine forces.

## 🦅 New Companion: Gunther Krinkleclaw
The birdman finally spoke, introducing himself as:

**Gunther Krinkleclaw**  
An aarakocra sorcerer guided by wind, storms, and chaos magic.

Gunther shared his origin:
- Born during a violent magical storm
- Raised as a hermit
- Recently called back into the world by the voice of the wind
- Lives by the mantra: *“Pickles with purpose.”*

Gunther joined the party as a traveling companion.

## 🚤 Downriver to the Hamlet
After several days of travel, the party arrived at a **small riverside hamlet** of humans and halflings.

The locals reported:
- A **strange green glow** upriver
- A young villager who entered the glow and never returned
- Food spoiling and unnatural stillness spreading nearby

The glow was identified as **Fey influence bleeding into the Material World**.

---

## 🍺 The Fey Tavern
Overnight, a **tavern appeared out of nowhere** in the hamlet.

Inside:
- The bartender revealed himself as a Fey representative
- The green fog was confirmed to be a **Fey marsh crossing over**
- A guardian known as the **Golden Hawk** watches over the marsh
- Time and memory behave unpredictably inside the fog

The party agreed to investigate.

---

## 🛒 Preparations
Before entering the fog:
- Potions and supplies were purchased
- Scales and fins from the river creatures were traded
- Wild magic caused unexpected effects (including **Gunther shrinking by several inches**)
- The party rested and prepared for another Fey incursion

---

## 🌫️ Entering the Green Fog
The party convinced the river captain to take them into the fog.

Upon entry:
- Sound dampened unnaturally
- Echoes vanished
- Anxiety and confusion set in
- **Memories began slipping**

Strange manifestations appeared:
- **Doppelgängers** formed from water
- Party members struggled to remember names — even their own
- Reality became unstable almost immediately

Combat broke out aboard the boat as duplicates attacked.

---

## ⏸️ Where We Left Off
- The party is **inside the Fey marsh**
- Memory loss and identity distortion have begun
- Doppelgängers have appeared
- The Golden Hawk’s domain lies ahead
- Escape is uncertain, and time may not behave normally

---

## 🎭 Notable Themes This Session
- Deception has consequences
- Fey bargains are never simple
- Gods are watching — closely
- Identity and memory are fragile
