# Session Summary – The Night Stonefire Hall Burned

## Prelude – Rumors in Ellsworth Crossing

While preparing for Cyrus’ concert at **Stonefire Hall**, the party gathered several rumors:

- Farmers report hearing **massive stomping** in the distance.
- Fishermen are catching **malformed fish** that taste wrong.
- Some fishermen have disappeared, though not unusually so.
- The **river shrine up north** has been sealed for weeks.
- Strange tattoo trends have begun in **Toman Head**.
- Basic Granitefoot was confirmed to have traveled toward **Toman Head**.

## The Concert at Stonefire Hall

- The tavern was packed beyond safe capacity.
- Ruby baked over 500 cookies and struck a 70/30 deal with the innkeeper.
- Cyrus performed multiple sets:
  - The first (a memorial for Jakom) was shaky.
  - The later sets were a success — the crowd was energized.

### The Trench Coat Incident

A suspicious “man” in a trench coat was exposed to be:

> **Three kobolds stacked on top of one another.**

Tension in the tavern escalated quickly.

## The Fire

During the chaos:

- Fire Bolt was cast into flour in the kitchen.
- Flour ignited explosively.
- Wild magic triggered.
- Ruby was teleported outside.
- The kitchen became an inferno.
- Stonefire Hall ultimately collapsed and burned down.

The innkeeper salvaged what gold he could.

## Tarn’s Intel

Tarn briefly escaped jail in rat form and later returned.

Through Tobin (cellmate), the party learned:

- A thieves’ organization called **The Coalition** operates in the city.
- The Coalition supports the return of magic.
- There is a hidden route into the noble quarter through the farmers’ quarter.
- The city employs large guard dogs.
- Jakom’s death may have been expected in some circles.

## The Street Execution

The trench coat kobolds were encountered again.

Gunter cast **Chaos Bolt**:

- Two kobolds died instantly.
- One escaped.

Guards responded immediately.
A javelin struck Gunter.

In desperation—

> **Gunter prays to Demy.**

A fireball descends from the sky.

Gunter is completely incinerated.

Only metal gear and **Flint’s Tear** remain.
