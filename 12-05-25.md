# Session Summary – River Passage and Stolen Eggs

## 🧳 Loose Ends in Town
- The party resolved unfinished business in town:
  - **Flint’s belongings** were recovered and distributed:
    - His sword
    - A tear-shaped gem representing *Flint’s sadness from imprisonment*  
  - The gem was ruled **inconsequential for inventory** (treated as part of gold value).

- The party confirmed they had **leveled up** and updated hit points and abilities.

- After discussion, the group decided to:
  - Spend **one more night in town**
  - Rest, resupply, and prepare to travel **downriver**

---

## 🚤 Negotiating Passage Downriver
- A **keelboat** arrived heading upriver, captained by a **well-dressed halfling woman**.
- After some tense (and humorous) negotiation, the captain agreed to take the party **downriver**:
  - **2 gold per person** to the next town
  - More expensive passage further south was declined

- The party paid a deposit and agreed to **depart at dawn**.

---

## 🌊 Trouble on the River
- While traveling downriver, the boat was forced to stop when **large river creatures** emerged and blocked passage.
- Communication revealed:
  - The river creatures now claimed this stretch of river
  - Their **eggs had been stolen the previous night**
- A deal was struck:
  - If the party recovered the stolen eggs, the ship would be allowed to pass safely

## 🌲 Into the Forest
- The party crossed the river and followed tracks into a **dense, dangerous forest**.
- Travel was slow and disorienting:
  - The trail faded repeatedly
  - The group became lost several times
  - Night fell before the tracks were fully traced

---

## 🦉 Owlbear Encounter
- The party discovered a **bone-filled cave** and identified signs of a dangerous predator.
- Inside, they encountered and defeated an **owlbear** after a tough fight.
- The cave contained:
  - Bones and scraps from previous victims
  - No stolen eggs (the owlbear was not the thief)
- Owlbear parts were harvested.

---

## 🌙 Night Ambush
- While resting in the forest, the party was attacked during the night by **animated twig- and tree-like creatures**.
- Despite the surprise, the group defeated the attackers with minimal injuries.
- The rest of the night passed without further incident.

## 🐻 Bugbear Camp
- In the morning, the trail was finally followed to a **bugbear camp**.

- A difficult battle followed:
  - Two eggs were recovered intact
  - One egg was **destroyed during the fight**
  - A second egg was damaged but **successfully healed**
- The bugbears were defeated and looted.

---

## 🌊 Return to the River
- Exhausted, the party navigated back through the forest after multiple setbacks.
- By evening, they returned to the river and the waiting boat.
- The river creatures were informed:
  - **Two eggs were returned intact**
  - **One egg was lost** despite the party’s efforts
